This whats app web page clone is heavily built using HTML & CSS and as you can tell, it was not easy lol.
One of my main struggles with this was getting the right background colour for the body using CSS. I can admit CSS isn't my strong point so this project took alot longer than I had planned it getting to look like a whats app page instead of a random message web page.
Also, getting the three unread messages to apear as unread messages was also challenging, so you can imagine my relif when I finally got it.
I didn't use JavaScript for this page, which isn't going to help me become better at JS but I didn't think it was needed for this project.
